# Oddam w dobre rÄ™ce

This project is a task from Portfolio Lab - a part of the course "JavaScript Developer: React" led by Coders Lab - IT School.

The purpose of this website is to help people who have things at home that they want to get rid of, but they don't know how. It's a place where everyone can give unnecessary items to trusted institutions - on the website there is a simple form that will help users donate things.

Under construction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
